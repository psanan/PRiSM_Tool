# Experimental Tool for PRiSM

## Quickstart

1. Install Jupyter. The easiest way is to install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com), but if you already work with Python, you can [install it with `pip`, `conda`, etc.](https://jupyter.org/install)

2. Install Julia by following [these instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

3. Install IJulia by running the Julia program you just downloaded, then

  - type `]` (closing bracket)
  - type `add IJulia`, then enter
  - type backspace
  - type `exit()`, then enter

4. Run Jupyter.

  - Open a terminal program (OS X: run the `Terminal` app)
  - Navigate to this directory (OS X: type `cd`, then drag this directory into the terminal, and type enter)
  - Type `jupyter notebook`, then type enter
  - If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the URL into your web browser. It will look something like

      http://localhost:8888/?token=95ffc789ab5152418e4bfb45cfae48f636283602a6a62d9

6. Open the notebook by clicking on `PRiSM_Tool.ipynb`.
